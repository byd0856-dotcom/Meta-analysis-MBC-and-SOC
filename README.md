This repository contains the analysis code used to reproduce the results reported in the manuscript “Meta-analysis Shows that Perennial Crops Promote Soil Microbial Biomass Accumulation and Organic Carbon Sequestration”. It includes scripts for data cleaning and standardization, effect-size calculation (log response ratio, LnRR), meta-analytic models, moderator analyses, and figure/table generation.
